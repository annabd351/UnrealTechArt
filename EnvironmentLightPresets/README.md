# EnvironmentLightPresets
This is an Unreal runtime system/editor tool for lighters which provides a unified way of controlling level-wide environment lighting-related actors (directional light, sky atmosphere, sky light, volumetric clouds, exponential height fog, and a postprocess volume).  It allows lighters to define presets, and store them in data assets.  It also provides a dynamic mixer, which lighters can use to blend between presets.  And it fully supports the Sequencer, allowing for runtime, dynamic, event-driven lighting changes (i.e. in response to changing weather).
