# VFX Placement Tool
This is an artist-requested tool/runtime system which helps with VFX distribution in large environments.  It allows you to place multiple instances of Niagara effects, and have them snap to surfaces.  You can configure it to re-trigger and re-distribute instances at specific intervals.

A canonical use case for this system is placing dripping water elements on the ceiling of a cavern.  With this tool, you place a single actor, and it automatically places and times the drips.
